There are several types of common concrete cracks namely hairline cracks which
usually develop in concrete foundation as the concrete cures, shrinkage cracks which
occur while the concrete is curing, settlement cracks which happen when part of
concrete sinks or when the ground underneath the slab isnâ€™t compacted properly as
well as structural cracks which form due to incorrect design.
Concrete cracks may endanger the safety and durability of a building if not eing
identified quickly and left untreated. Hence, your job as an AI engineer is tasked to
perform image classification to classify concretes with or without cracks
